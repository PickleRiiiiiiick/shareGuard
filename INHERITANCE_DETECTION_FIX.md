# Inheritance Detection Fix Summary

## Issue
The Finance folder was expected to show broken inheritance (inheritance disabled) in health issues, but it wasn't being detected.

## Root Cause
The Windows permission scanner (`src/scanner/file_scanner.py`) was not checking whether inheritance was enabled or disabled at the folder level. It only checked individual ACE inheritance flags but not the security descriptor control flags.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Inheritance Detection in file_scanner.py
Added code to check the `SE_DACL_PROTECTED` flag in the security descriptor control:

```python
# Check if inheritance is disabled by looking at the security descriptor control flags
sd_control = sd.GetSecurityDescriptorControl()
# SE_DACL_PROTECTED flag indicates that inheritance is disabled
inheritance_enabled = not (sd_control[0] & win32security.SE_DACL_PROTECTED)
```

### 2. Added inheritance_enabled to Return Data
Updated the `get_folder_permissions` method to include the `inheritance_enabled` field in the returned dictionary:

```python
return {
    "path": folder_path,
    "folder_info": folder_info,
    "owner": owner_info,
    "primary_group": group_info,
    "inheritance_enabled": inheritance_enabled,  # Added this field
    "aces": aces,
    # ... rest of the data
}
```

### 3. Health Analyzer Already Supports It
The health analyzer (`src/core/health_analyzer.py`) was already looking for `inheritance_enabled` field and creating issues when it's `False`. No changes were needed there.

## Testing

### Created Test Scripts:
1. **test_inheritance_detection.py** - Python script to test the scanner directly
2. **Test-InheritanceDetection.ps1** - PowerShell script to verify inheritance status using Windows tools
3. **rescan_and_check_finance.py** - Script to rescan Finance folder and verify broken inheritance is detected

### To Test the Fix:
1. Run the PowerShell test to see actual Windows inheritance status:
   ```powershell
   .\Test-InheritanceDetection.ps1
   ```

2. Rescan the Finance folder and check health:
   ```powershell
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   python rescan_and_check_finance.py
   ```

3. Or manually rescan and run health check:
   ```powershell
   # Rescan
   python run_permission_scan.py "C:\ShareGuardTest\Finance"
   
   # Run health scan
   python run_health_scan.py
   ```

## Expected Behavior
After the fix, when scanning a folder with inheritance disabled:
1. The scan result will include `"inheritance_enabled": false`
2. The health analyzer will create a "Broken Inheritance" issue with MEDIUM severity
3. The issue will appear in the health dashboard

## Technical Details
- **SE_DACL_PROTECTED**: Windows security descriptor flag that indicates the DACL is protected from inheritance
- When this flag is set, the folder does not inherit permissions from its parent
- This is often a sign of custom security configuration that may need review
